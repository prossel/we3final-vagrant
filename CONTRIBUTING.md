# Contributing

THMcards needs you! If you are interested in helping, here is a short guide:

1. First, fork and clone our repository.
2. Create a topic branch.
3. Make your changes. Be sure to provide clean commits and to write [expressive commit messages][commit-message].
4. Push the changes to your topic branch.
5. Finally, [submit a pull request][pull-request].

If you don't feel like writing code, you could also update the documentation. And if you find any bugs, feel free to [open a new issue][new-issue].
